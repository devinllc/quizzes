The Quiz App is a dynamic, time-based quiz application built using the Flutter framework. This app is designed to offer users an engaging quiz experience where they can answer multiple-choice questions fetched from an API in a fixed amount of time. Users can navigate through questions, skip them, and submit their answers before time runs out.

The app features:

A total quiz duration of 150 seconds.
Randomized questions and options fetched from an external API.
The ability to skip questions, giving users flexibility in how they approach the quiz.
A final summary screen displaying the total score, number of correct, wrong, and skipped answers, along with a breakdown of the questions and their correct answers.
The app is user-friendly and has a clean UI design, with gradient backgrounds, smooth transitions, and responsive buttons. It is perfect for learning purposes, gamification of quizzes, or enhancing knowledge in a fun way. It also demonstrates essential Flutter development techniques, including state management, API integration, and custom UI components.
